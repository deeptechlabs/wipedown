This directory is used by the gpgdir test suite to store test output (both
stdout and stderr) from various tests against gpgdir.  The gpgdir test suite
creates files in this directory with a ".N" extension according to each test
number.

The files in this directory are useful for debugging purposes, and if there is
a problem running gpgdir on a particular system then the information in this
directory along with the output of the test suite may provide a clues as to
why.  If gpgdir appears to not be working properly and you want additional
help to diagnose the problem, you can tar up the output/ directory and send it
to Michael Rash at the following email address: mbr@cipherdyne.org
