Per Ronny Westin
    - Found PLAINTEXT vs. DECRYPTION_OKAY return code bug for GnuPG 1.2.6.
    - Reported directory decryption bug in gpgdir-1.6.  The result was the
      addition of the gpgdir test suite.

Kai Raven
    - Bugfix in man page for file compression/decompression wording.

Craig Needs
    - Suggested --gnupg-dir option, testing help.

Chris P
    - Found bug where gpgdir would not decrypt files that contained spaces.

Ian Scott
    - Reported "protocol error: expected SHM_GET_XXX got GOOD_PASSPHRASE"
      bug in GnuPG module.

Mate Wierdl
    - Contributed patch (originally for the psad project) for building the
      RPM on x86_64 platforms.

pyllyukko
    - Added the gpgdir.SlackBuild script (adapted from the psad project).

Anthony Chivetta
    - Submitted patch to fix a bug where files named "0.gpg" could not be
      decrypted.
    - Submitted patch to implement the --overwrite-encrypted command line
      argument to allow previously encrypted files to be overwritten. This
      is useful for updating an encrypted directory with new versions of
      the previously encrypted files.

Fermin Manzanedo
    - Suggested the --Symmetric option so that files can be encrypted/
      decrypted via a symmetric cipher (GnuPG supports CAST5 by default).

Franck Joncourt
    - Performed analysis of locale settings for fwknop installer and suggested
      using the LC_ALL environmental variable instead of the LANG variable
      (which is superseded by LC_* vars).
    - Suggested moving perl modules to the deps/ directory.  This is to
      support the integration of the Cipherdyne projects with Debian.
    - Added Short description to the gpgdir man page.  This fixes the
      following lintian warning:

        http://lintian.debian.org/tags/manpage-has-bad-whatis-entry.html
    - Suggested the appropriate bugfix to interface non-interactively with the
      wipe program (-f instead of -I in later versions).

Lars Wilke
    - Reported a bug in missing the proper handling of files with spaces when
      using the --Wipe secure deletion mode.
    - Suggested the ability to encrypt/decrypt hidden files, and --Force now
      supports this.

Ben Staude
    - Submitted a patch to allow multiple --Exclude patterns to be specified
      directly from the command line.
