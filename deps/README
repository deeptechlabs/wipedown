This directory contains perl modules and other dependencies used by gpgdir.
These dependencies are included in this directory to ease the installation
process, but if gpgdir is being installed on a system where all necessary
dependencies are already installed then it is recommended to install from one
of the gpgdir "nodeps" tarballs or RPM's.  These distributions of gpgdir do
not include any perl modules or other dependencies:
