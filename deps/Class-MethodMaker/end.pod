=head1 COMPATIBILITY NOTES

Users porting from the v1 versions of Class::MethodMaker would do well to
observe the following:

=over 4

=item ima_method_maker

This class method is deprecated.  It was a way round the fact the C::MM works
out what class to create methods in by looking up the calling stack.  It is
unfortunate, for the first C::MM class in the calling stack that sets
ima_method_maker to be false gets the method --- that may not be what is
wanted (i.e., if one derived class calls another for C::MM work).

By calling create_methods, the target class may is explicitly specified in the
argument list.
