Installation notes:

QUICK AND EASY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Just run the gpgdir installation script "install.pl" from the gpgdir
sources directory:

# ./install.pl

If you are not installing as root, the install.pl script will install gpgdir
along with required perl modules within your home directory.  If you are
installing as root, required perl modules will be installed in /usr/lib/gpgdir
so as to not pollute the system perl library tree.  The required perl modules
are GnuPG::Interface, Class::MethodMaker, and Term::ReadKey, and these modules
are placed in the deps/ directory.
